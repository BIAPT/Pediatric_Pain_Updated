# Pediatric_Pain_Updated

Children with chronic musculoskeletal pain and healthy children were recruited from the Shriner's Hospital of Canada. All participants completed a resting-state EEG using the DSI-24, a 19-channel dry EEG headset. All children also completed quantitative sensory testing QST, with EEG recorded throughout the QST. This project compared the resting-state EEG to EEG recorded throughout a cold pressor task.
